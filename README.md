# maplibre-native-qt

MapLibre Native Qt bindings and Qt Location MapLibre Plugin

**Important notice:** the repository and code have been reorganised for Qt 6.5 support.
Version 3.0 is a major release that includes a lot of build-related changes
and improvements and is not backwards compatible.

## Qt support

This library fully supports Qt 6.5 and newer.
Qt 5.15 is fully supported only on desktop platforms, previous Qt 5 versions
down to 5.6 only support widgets but not Qt Location.

## Get and build

The project uses submodules, so you need to clone it with the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-qt.git
cd maplibre-native-qt
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

(On some file systems, the submodule update may yield a `Filename too long` error
which can be ignored.)

For more details on building the project, see [How to build](docs/Building.md).

## How to use?

Once installed `QMapLibre` can be used in any Qt and CMake project.
Two example projects based on Qt 6 are available in the
[examples](examples) directory.

To build an example, run the following commands:

```shell
export QMapLibre_DIR="<absolute-path-to-install>"
cmake --workflow --preset default
```

or alternatively

```shell
mkdir build-example && cd build-example
qt-cmake ../maplibre-native-qt/examples/<example> -GNinja \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER="ccache" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER="ccache" \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<absolute-path-to-install>"
ninja
```

For more details on using the library, see [Usage](docs/Usage.md).
