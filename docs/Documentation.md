# Documentation

This is the documentation of the public MapLibre Native bindings for Qt.
You would normally use this API in a Qt-based application.
If you are interested in the internals of MapLibre Native you can also look at
[Core C++ API](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-native/cpp/api/).

If not explicitly specified, all classes and functions are available
as of version 3.0 of the library.

The source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-qt):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-qt.git
cd maplibre-native-qt
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

@note On some file systems, the submodule update may yield a `Filename too long`
error. It can be ignored as only some dependencies test data will be missing.
